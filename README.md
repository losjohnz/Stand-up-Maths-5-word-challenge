# Stand-up-Maths-5-word-challenge

Yet another code taking on Parker's 5 word puzzle!

This code requires the "words_alpha.txt" file to be present in the same directory in order to run properly. It contains all the acceptable English words for the code to work with.  
It will generate two txt files. One with all 5-letter words (five_words.txt) and one with all 538 unique solutions (palavras_finais.txt).

This code calculates the answer in about 2 minutes which is an improvement over our lovely host's 32 days.
There are even more optimized codes out there that can calculate the answer in less than a millisecond.
